    **ncls-brn/ncls-brn** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on
    your GitHub profile.

    After having worked for 10 years  in the  French Army, I am now retraining in web development,
    a sector in which I have discovered the wealth of       
    professions (creativity, teamwork , problem solving, etc.) 
    as well as the major impact on both companies and society in general.
